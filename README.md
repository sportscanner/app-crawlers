### What is it about?
[sportscanner](https://shuttle-bot.onrender.com/) is a webapp that helps badminton players find
available badminton slots for the upcoming week, across London,
with the option to search for consecutively available slots

The webapp is developed on top of Streamlit `(using Python >= 3.10)` and employs concurrent concepts of Async to parse different websites for badminton slots availability in smaller response times. Async in Python allows the program to proceed while it **await**s for the web requests to be processed, enabling quick response times.

### Features
- Currently supports `20` badminton centres across London
- Option to filter available badminton slots based on given time ranges
- searches badminton slots for the upcoming 6-7 days depending on published slots by providers
> This means the number of API calls become `20 sports centres` **x** `6-days` **~** 120, therefore the need for Asynchronous to improve UX
- Displays the location metadata (in miles) on how far a badminton centre is from the user,
  based on postcode search (Postcode search supported by `https://postcodes.io/`)
